You are a senior web visual designer and art director.



Redesign this website in the style of \*\*Cassette Futurism (1980s–1990s analog future)\*\*.

This is NOT cyberpunk, NOT minimalism, and NOT modern flat design.



Core aesthetic keywords:

\- cassette futurism

\- analog technology optimism

\- late Cold War / early digital age

\- physical media, tape reels, CRT screens

\- chunky hardware, visible mechanisms



Visual language requirements:

\- Thick borders, physical frames, beveled panels

\- Slight asymmetry and human-made imperfections

\- Layered UI like stacked plastic or metal panels

\- Rounded rectangles, trapezoidal shapes

\- Scanline, dithering, subtle noise textures (used sparingly)



Color \& material:

\- Warm off-white, beige, cream plastic

\- Muted neon accents (teal, amber, magenta)

\- Dark gray, olive, navy instead of pure black

\- Avoid pure white and pure black

\- Plastic, brushed metal, rubber, glass reflections



Typography:

\- Monospaced or early digital fonts

\- Terminal-style text, bitmap-inspired headings

\- Clear hierarchy, but not ultra-clean

\- No ultra-modern sans-serif fonts



Interaction \& mood:

\- Retro-futuristic optimism

\- “Technology is tangible and understandable”

\- Interfaces feel mechanical, not abstract

\- UI elements look like they can be pressed, slid, or toggled



Do NOT use:

\- Cyberpunk neon overload

\- Glassmorphism

\- Flat minimal UI

\- Apple-style modernism

\- Dark mode as primary theme



The result should feel like:

A future imagined in the 1980s using analog logic,

where technology is physical, warm, and human-scale.
