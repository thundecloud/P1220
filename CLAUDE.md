You must:



Continuously maintain Readme.md and Todo.md (located at the same level as ai-trpg-engine) so the project is always in a handover-ready state.



After each completed change, commit and push to the remote repository. You decide the commit summary and description.



Update 更新日志.md after every change, strictly following chronological order (earliest → latest).



These rules are mandatory and must be followed for all future actions.
